## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS
- Chart JS

### What I learned

- This is my first time using ChartJS and it was quite fun but unsurprisingly a little annoying! What I didn't like about how I used this framework is that I am still not fully familiar with JavaScript and I had to do a lot of searching things up and just typing it out from what I see. Though I understand how to use it, I don't fully understand what it does. However, I don't think I will be needing this framework any time soon so I will not be learning it now.

- I also learnt about the [7 - 1 pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) for SCSS which was absolutely awesome as it made writing SCSS so much easier and cleaner.

### Continued development

I will continue to learn about SCSS and how it can be used to make styling easier by using functions and mixins and other things that SCSS has.

### Useful resources

- [SCSS guide-sheet](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) - This helped be learn a lot more about SCSS and how to use it as an advantage.
- [Chart JS](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) - This helped me with ChartJS syntax.
